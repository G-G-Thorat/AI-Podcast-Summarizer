In this application, I will walk you through the development of an AI-Powered Podcast Summarizer & Chatbot, utilizing OpenAI Whisper, Pinecone, and GPT-4o for conversational AI. The final product is a fully interactive Streamlit application where users can upload a podcast audio file, receive an AI-generated summary, and chat with the content to extract key insights.

For instance, if you have a long podcast episode but don't have the time to listen to the entire recording, this AI-powered tool will transcribe, summarize, and let you ask questions about it. If you prefer listening over reading, the chatbot can even generate spoken responses using Whisper's Text-to-Speech capabilities.
